# Notes

## 1. Geolocation API

- i got my first introduction to the geolocation api. it's pretty cool.
- i will make a branch from this commit so that i can play with the API some more
  - i will do this for other lessons i find intruiging
- that's it. nothing else to add. we move

## 2. [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com)

- this library is so cool. i'm going to be using this in my web portfolio
- also, explore the differet tile layers options. doesn't seem too complicated and it seems there's many ways to customise your map using it

## 3. Displaying the Map Marker (Upon Click)

- went through the leaflet documentation and eventually learnt how to: 
  - customise the marker, with its many options (via making an object)
  - how to set custom text
  - and, how to add our custom css classes to the marker
